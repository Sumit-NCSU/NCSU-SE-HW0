Demo: post-commit hooks in Git.

2
00:00:02 --> 00:00:07
This video demonstrates the use of post-commit hooks in Git.

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
I have created a post-commit script and placed it in the hooks folder within the .git folder of my repo.

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
The script will be used to open a web page whenever a commit is made in the repo.

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:27
Now, when I do a commit from command line, the script will be executed and the webpage will open in Firefox.

Thank You.
